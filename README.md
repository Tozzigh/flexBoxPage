https://github.com/breatheco-de/landing-page-javascript/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true

The best way to learn is by creating real life projects, this is the typical landing page your boss or a startup company owner will like to build.

## üìù Instructions

Demonstrate how you can build this beautiful landing page without the need of bootstrap:

1. Build a landing page [like the one on this image](https://github.com/breatheco-de/landing-page-javascript/blob/master/landing.png?raw=true).
2. You can find the landing page asset images on the `./img` folder.
1. Start by building your strategy, [here is an example strategy](https://github.com/breatheco-de/landing-page-javascript/blob/master/strategy.png?raw=true).
1. Use [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to help you with your layouts.
2. Reuse your CSS classes, use behavioral class names like `padding-1` or `continainer` instead project related names like `the-dog` or `my_header`.
3. Make it look exactly like the picture, pixel perfect!

Additional goals (if you feel confident):

+ Use javascript to capture the user email and send it using [formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co/)
